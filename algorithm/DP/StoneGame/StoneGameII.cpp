There is a stone game.At the beginning of the game the player picks n piles of stones in a circle.

The goal is to merge the stones in one pile observing the following rules:

At each step of the game,the player can merge two adjacent piles to a new pile.
The score is the number of stones in the new pile.
You are to determine the minimum of the total score.
Example
For [1, 4, 4, 1], in the best solution, the total score is 18:

1. Merge second and third piles => [2, 4, 4], score +2
2. Merge the first two piles => [6, 4]，score +6
3. Merge the last two piles => [10], score +10
Other two examples:
[1, 1, 1, 1] return 8
[4, 4, 5, 9] return 43

A[0],A[1:n-2],A[n-1]
F[i,j]=sum[i:j]+F[i,k]+F[k+1,j]
